## Abstract
In medical emergencies, quickly finding and contacting blood donors can be life-saving. Donor Link addresses this by offering a real-time alert system for donors based on blood type and location, reducing the time to find a match. It stores detailed donor information, including health parameters like blood pressure and hemoglobin levels, allowing users to identify suitable donors. During emergencies, alerts are sent to local donors, facilitating rapid response. Users can also search for donors by locality and health traits. Leveraging Vultr's cloud services, Donor Link ensures scalability, data security, and responsiveness, aiming to enhance blood donation efficiency and save lives in critical situations.

## Problem Statement (Health and Wellbeing)
In emergencies, the timely availability of blood donors is critical. Current methods for locating donors are inefficient and slow, often relying on manual calls and social media, which delays responses and impacts patient outcomes. There is no real-time, location-based notification service, and existing systems lack online databases that allow filtering by blood type and health status. This inefficiency hinders the ability to quickly connect with suitable donors. A 24/7 accessible system that notifies donors and allows them to reach hospitals before patients arrive would significantly improve response times and outcomes.

## Proposed Solution
Donor Link enhances blood donation in emergencies with the following features:

1. **Comprehensive Online Database:**
   - **Donor Information:** Stores essential details like blood type, health conditions, and vaccination history for each donor.
   - **24/7 Availability:** Ensures round-the-clock access to donor profiles and information.
  
2. **Real-Time Notification Service:**
   - **Immediate Emergency Alerts:** Notifies eligible donors promptly when their blood type is urgently needed, allowing them to reach the hospital ahead of time.
   - **Location-Specific Alerts:** Sends real-time notifications based on proximity and compatible blood types.

3. **Enhanced Search and Filter Options:**
   - **Powerful Search Features:** Enables finding donors by specific blood type, geographic location, and relevant health attributes.
   - **Direct User Interaction:** Allows users to view donor profiles and directly request donations when necessary.

4. **Seamless Integration with Healthcare Providers:**
   - **Hospital Connectivity:** Facilitates smooth coordination by linking with hospitals for real-time donor and patient matching.

## Preliminary Diagram
The Donor Link web app, designed in Figma, features a header with a logo on the left and a navigation menu on the right, including **Home, Find Donors, Hospitals, Lives Saved, and Profile**. The **Find Donors** section provides access to donor info and nearby hospitals. The **Lives Saved** section shows total blood donations and lives saved. The **Profile** section displays users' personal information, including health details, age, and blood group.

The **Connect** button adds a social dimension to the app, allowing users to interact and build a network of donors and recipients. It facilitates seamless communication and engagement, transforming the app into a platform where users can support and respond to life-saving alerts in real time, fostering a community dedicated to saving lives.

The **Donor Dashboard** in the Donor Link app provides a comprehensive view of donor information and ensures users are always updated on their role in the community. Each donor's profile includes essential details such as blood type, health status, donation history, and contact information. This dashboard is designed to offer a complete overview, helping donors stay informed and engaged.

Real-time notifications are crucial, keeping donors updated on urgent needs and local emergencies. Donors receive instant alerts about accidents or immediate blood needs, along with guidance on how to contribute. This helps them act quickly and make a significant impact, enhancing responsiveness and supporting a dynamic blood donation network.
